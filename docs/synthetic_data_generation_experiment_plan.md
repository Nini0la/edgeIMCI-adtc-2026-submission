# EdgeIMCI Synthetic Data Generation Experiment Plan

> **Authority:** `WORKING_PLAN` · **Lifecycle:** `CURRENT` · Maintained Markdown working version; the corresponding DOCX is its source snapshot.

*Whole-encounter rendering, controlled bake-offs and a two-speed route to scale*

**Status:** Working plan; time and cost figures are planning estimates until measured.

> **Core design:** One complete canonical child encounter is the semantic unit. The deterministic oracle supplies clinical truth; the teacher renders coherent, realistic PHC-worker input and appropriate target language.

## 1. Generation unit and responsibility boundary

A whole-encounter request contains the full relevant child context - for example age, danger signs, respiratory, diarrhoea, fever/measles and ear findings - together with required classifications, actions and completeness state. It is not split into independently generated IMCI pathway fragments.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Deterministic oracle | Defines semantic truth: required classifications, actions, completeness/withholding and urgent handling. |
| Teacher model | Primarily converts the approved semantics into realistic PHC-worker language and an integrated target response. |
| Validator | Checks semantic fidelity, required content and detectable rendering failures; returns pass/fail plus error codes. |
| Student evaluation | Determines whether a generation recipe ultimately improves the trained EdgeIMCI model; validator acceptance is an intermediate proxy. |

*A bake-off may compare a single teacher call that renders both sides with a more controlled two-stage rendering path. In either design, the complete encounter remains available so the language stays internally coherent.*

## 2. Experiment definition and campaign

Experiment/run = one fixed generation configuration. Request = one semantic encounter processed within that run. Change one principal factor at a time where possible.

| Stage | What varies | Decision/output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Teacher / prompt bake-off | 2-3 teachers x 1-2 prompt/rendering strategies on the same 50-100-case slice | Choose a stable, high-fidelity rendering recipe |
| 2. Variant-count experiment | 1 vs 2 vs 4 renderings per semantic encounter | Measure diversity gain against cost and duplication |
| 3. Fast controlled corpus | Generate about 500-1,000 accepted examples with the chosen recipe | Start SFT-v1 quickly |
| 4. Dataset-scale generation | Approximately 1k to 3k to 10k, possibly 20k/30k | Support learning-curve and larger-data experiments |
| 5. Quality/diversity refinement | Prompt or renderer changes only if early data show mode collapse, awkward language or systematic rejections | Correct observed failure modes |

**A reasonably complete campaign may contain roughly 10-14 generation runs; the critical path is smaller:** 4-6 bake-off runs, one fast corpus run, inspection, then scale only when justified.

## 3. Prompt and generation provenance

Store prompts once in version control and reference them from generated records by ID, version and immutable hash. Do not duplicate full prompt text into every item.

| Group | Required provenance |
| --- | --- |
| Run/config | `generation_run_id`; `teacher_provider`; `teacher_model`; `teacher_snapshot`; `prompt_id`; `prompt_version`; `prompt_hash`; `sampling_config`; `variants_per_case`; `validator_version` |
| Item identity | `semantic_case_id`; `variant_id`; `attempt_id`; parent generation run |
| Validation | `validation_pass`; `validation_error_codes`; rejected reason; reviewer override if any |
| Usage | `input_tokens`; `output_tokens`; cached tokens if applicable; latency; retry count; provider request ID; raw cost/usage response |
| Data/code | semantic-set version/hash; renderer code git commit; output artifact/hash; timestamps and status |

## 4. Acceptance, quality and cost metrics

- Acceptance rate and semantic error rate by teacher, prompt and variant policy.
- Error-code distribution, retry rate, duplicate/near-duplicate rate and language-diversity indicators.
- Mean and p95 latency, accepted examples per hour, tokens per accepted example and attempts per accepted example.
- Cost per attempt and cost per accepted example, derived from raw usage and a versioned rate card.
- Student clinical performance by generation recipe - the final arbiter when validator metrics and training utility disagree.

## 5. Two-speed execution strategy

```text
CLINICAL APPROVAL + HOLISTIC GOLDEN SEMANTIC SET
                    |
50-100 CASE TEACHER / PROMPT BAKE-OFF
                    |
STABLE RECIPE + HIGH ACCEPTANCE + NO SYSTEMATIC CORRUPTION
          /-----------------------------------\
FAST STANDARD API: ~500-1,000          LARGE AZURE BATCH
          |                              10k / 20k / 30k
QWEN3-1.7B SFT-v1 ON MODAL                 |
          |                               ARRIVES LATER
CLINICAL EVAL + ERROR ANALYSIS  <---- NEXT TRAINING EXPERIMENTS
```

### Phase A - fast lane

Use the standard API for approximately 500-1,000 validated examples so SFT can start within hours rather than waiting for asynchronous scale.

### Phase B - scale lane

Once the recipe is demonstrably stable, submit a much larger Azure Batch job. Modal fine-tuning, evaluation and error analysis continue while the batch is processing, so its elapsed time is hidden behind useful work.

*When the large corpus arrives, preserve two routes where affordable: continue SFT-v1 for the pragmatic strongest model, and train a matched checkpoint from the same base for the scientific dataset-scale comparison.*

## 6. Planning time ranges

> **Estimate notice:** These are working ranges, not provider SLAs. Concurrency, quota, output length, validator speed and acceptance/retry rate can materially change them. Reforecast after the first approximately 100 requests.

| Accepted target / bake-off | API generation estimate | Planning window including validation + retries |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 100-case experiment | ~5-15 min | ~15-30 min |
| 500 | ~15-40 min | ~30-60 min |
| 1,000 | ~30-60 min | ~1-2 h |
| 3,000 | ~1-3 h | ~2-4 h |
| 10,000 | ~4-8 h | ~5-10 h |
| 30,000 | ~12-24 h | ~15-30 h |

*Forecast replacement metrics:* `accepted_examples_per_hour`; `mean_request_latency`; `p95_request_latency`; `retry_rate`; `tokens_per_accepted_example`; `cost_per_accepted_example`.

## 7. Cost and accounting model

Do not hard-code provider prices into the experiment record. Retain actual input/output token counts, request mode, deployment/region and provider usage response; calculate dollars through a versioned rate card.

| Measure | Accounting concept |
| --- | --- |
| Attempt cost | (input tokens x input rate) + (output tokens x output rate) + any applicable service components |
| Accepted-example cost | Total generation + validation/retry cost / accepted examples |
| Batch planning placeholder | Standard-mode estimate x documented batch discount assumption; label assumption, rate-card date and region |
| Reconciliation | Replace estimate with actual provider usage/invoice data while preserving both estimate and actual |

*Optional planning assumption from the current discussion: begin forecasting with approximately 1,500 input and 700 output tokens per whole encounter, then replace these values with observed means after 50-100 requests. This is a placeholder, not a specification.*

## 8. Gates and next actions

- Freeze the holistic golden semantic slice and validator version for the first bake-off.
- Run teacher/prompt comparisons on identical cases; review both validator outcomes and language quality.
- Select a recipe only after stable acceptance, no systematic semantic corruption and sensible cost/throughput.
- Generate the fast approximately 1k corpus and start Qwen3-1.7B SFT-v1 on Modal.
- Submit the large Azure Batch lane in parallel; do not block fine-tuning or evaluation on its completion.
- Reforecast time and cost after approximately 100 requests and retain the measured forecast in the run registry.
