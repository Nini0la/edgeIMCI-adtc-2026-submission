# EdgeIMCI

EdgeIMCI is a hackathon research project testing whether a small, locally deployable language model can turn free-form primary-health-care findings from a whole sick-child encounter into the complete set of supported IMCI classifications and an integrated management response—while handling missing information and urgent findings safely.

The target interaction is:

```text
free-form whole-encounter PHC findings
        |
        v
small EdgeIMCI instruct model
        |
        v
integrated classifications and management
+ safe incomplete-assessment behavior
```

This repository is research software. It is **not** a production medical device, does not authorize autonomous clinical use, and does not claim coverage of every IMCI pathway or follow-up algorithm.

## Current status

The clinical-semantic foundation for the bounded hackathon scope is implemented. A 78-case product-level holistic semantic suite has been constructed deterministically and is awaiting domain review; it is not yet frozen.

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Major sick-child clinical rule set and provenance | Implemented and versioned |
| Whole-encounter schema | Implemented |
| Mechanical completeness oracle | Implemented and deterministic |
| Integrated classification/action oracle | Deterministic; approved for the bounded hackathon representation |
| Clinical/policy review | All 13 recorded questions resolved and versioned |
| Automated verification | Full deterministic suite maintained in `tests/` |
| Archived selected-v0 14-case component slice | Frozen historical/component-regression artifact; product-ineligible |
| Product-level holistic golden semantic set | 78 proposed cases constructed; domain review is the remaining freeze gate |
| Golden language renderings | Not yet frozen |
| Experiment/run registry infrastructure | Planned, not yet implemented |
| Bulk corpus generation | Not started |
| SFT/model training | Not started |
| Target-hardware profiling of a trained checkpoint | Not started |

The approved review decisions are canonical in [`imci_major_sick_child_review_decisions_v1.json`](configs/information_policy/imci_major_sick_child_review_decisions_v1.json), with a generated YAML mirror. This approval is limited to the project’s hackathon representation and is not production clinical authorization.

## Supported encounter scope

`imci-major-sick-child-v1` covers the initial sick-child assessment for children aged 2 completed months to under 5 years across:

- general danger signs;
- cough or difficult breathing;
- diarrhoea;
- fever, including measles; and
- ear problem.

It is paired with `imci-major-sick-child-holistic-completeness-v2`. Omitted findings remain `UNKNOWN`; silence is never treated as a negative finding.

The product-level behavior is:

```text
COMPLETE SUPPORTED ENCOUNTER
→ emit integrated classifications and management

INCOMPLETE, NO KNOWN URGENT FINDING
→ report grouped missing assessment elements
→ withhold final holistic synthesis

INCOMPLETE, KNOWN URGENT FINDING
→ emit source-backed urgent/pre-referral actions immediately
→ report the remaining rapid assessment
→ withhold final holistic synthesis
```

Urgency does not make the encounter complete. The remaining supported assessment must be completed rapidly without delaying referral or pre-referral treatment. When urgent referral is triggered, routine home-care courses and scheduled follow-up are deferred from the immediate workflow unless the source explicitly makes them pre-referral or transfer actions.

The current scope is the **initial assessment only**. It may state source-backed follow-up timing, but it does not execute later IMCI follow-up-visit algorithms.

## Clinical source and provenance

The EdgeIMCI rule sets are machine-readable artifacts derived from **WHO — Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, Chart Booklet, March 2014**. They are not WHO-authored machine-readable rule sets.

The expanded rule set uses PDF viewer pages 5–9 and linked treatment/reassessment pages. Every encoded logic unit records source provenance. The WHO PDF is not redistributed; obtain it separately and place it at:

```text
data/sources/IMCI chartbooklet 2014.pdf
```

See [`data/sources/README.md`](data/sources/README.md), [`major_sick_child_expansion_map_v1.md`](docs/major_sick_child_expansion_map_v1.md), and [`clinical_questions.md`](docs/clinical_questions.md).

The older `imci-selected-v0` rule set remains frozen as a historical development/regression substrate. It covers only general danger signs, selected cough/difficult-breathing logic, and dehydration classification. It must not be described as the complete IMCI respiratory or diarrhoea algorithm.

## Deterministic architecture

Clinical truth is constructed and verified by deterministic artifacts, not invented by a language model:

```text
versioned clinical rules
        +
whole-encounter observations
        +
holistic completeness policy
        |
        v
deterministic evaluator
        |
        +-- encounter completeness
        +-- internal and final classifications
        +-- urgent/intermediate/deferred/final actions
        +-- grouped missing elements
        +-- rule/action provenance traces
```

The hackathon research model will ultimately be evaluated on whether it learns this bounded behavior from language. A future production architecture would likely separate structured extraction, deterministic clinical evaluation, and language presentation more strictly.

## Install and test

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest
```

The canonical clinical and policy artifacts are JSON. Their YAML files are generated, human-readable mirrors. Regenerate the expanded mirrors with:

```bash
python scripts/sync_holistic_artifacts.py
```

Tests reject JSON/YAML drift, unknown evaluator rule IDs, invalid scope pins, incomplete decision sets, and relevant clinical/completeness regressions.

## Immediate next gate: review and freeze the holistic golden semantic set

The proposed `edge-imci-holistic-product-golden-v1` suite contains 78 structured cases using `corpus_role=HOLISTIC_PRODUCT_GOLDEN`. It is canonical as JSONL with a YAML mirror, pins the approved clinical/policy/oracle identities, and is mechanically recomputed by `edge-imci-holistic-golden-validator-v1`.

Each structured golden case should pin:

- complete encounter observations and explicit unknowns;
- supported-encounter completeness;
- simultaneous classifications across pathways;
- urgent, intermediate, deferred, and final actions;
- grouped missing elements for incomplete cases;
- exact rule/action traces and provenance; and
- any applicable approved review decision.

The proposed set includes complete encounters, every encoded classification family, multiple simultaneous conditions, explicit-negative/omission twins, urgent-incomplete cases, respiratory reassessment, initial Plan B/C behavior, malaria contexts, HIV/chest-indrawing, cholera, measles, ear boundaries, contradictions, and schema-rejected out-of-scope cases.

`HPG-GAP-REASSESS-001` is resolved by the versioned product-scope disposition `edge-imci-holistic-golden-scope-dispositions-v1`. Holistic golden v1 covers the initial dehydration classification, Plan B/C action, and timed-reassessment instruction. It does not execute longitudinal treatment state or automatic plan loops; a later full updated assessment may be submitted and evaluated afresh. This is an interaction/product-scope decision, not a new clinical rule.

The current suite is eligible only for domain review and component validation. Its manifest rejects holistic generation, product evaluation, teacher bake-offs, and training. Only after the semantic review is complete and the suite is frozen should the project establish golden language renderings and run the decisive teacher/prompt bake-off. See the [requirements](docs/product_holistic_golden_suite_requirements_v1.md) and [review package](docs/product_holistic_golden_review_v1.md).

## Experimental campaign

The hackathon critical path is evidence-driven:

1. freeze the holistic golden semantic set and validator;
2. run 4–6 teacher/prompt bake-off runs over the same 50–100 cases;
3. select a stable generation recipe with high semantic acceptance and no systematic corruption;
4. generate a fast corpus of approximately 500–1,000 accepted examples;
5. start Qwen3-1.7B SFT-v1 on Modal;
6. launch the larger Azure Batch data lane in parallel when justified;
7. run holistic classification, integrated-management, completeness, and urgent-incomplete evaluations;
8. profile the selected deployable artifact on ASUS/target hardware; and
9. select/submit or take only the branch justified by the measured bottleneck.

SFT-v2, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3.5/Tinker, preference optimization or RL, SVD/compression, expanded quantization comparisons, and Lundin evaluation are conditional branches. They are not prerequisites for the first submission.

The operating plans are:

- [`experimental_campaign_map.md`](docs/experimental_campaign_map.md)
- [`synthetic_data_generation_experiment_plan.md`](docs/synthetic_data_generation_experiment_plan.md)
- [`experiment_operations_and_tracking_plan.md`](docs/experiment_operations_and_tracking_plan.md)
- [`experiments/README.md`](experiments/README.md)

Before the campaign expands, each generation, training, evaluation, and profile runner should automatically create a versioned run sidecar containing configuration identity, inputs, outputs, hashes, telemetry, status, and raw provider usage. Scientific results must remain distinguishable from execution time and derived cost.

## Historical v0 regression assets

The committed `data/benchmark/imci_v0.jsonl` is an exposed 82-case development/regression set. It is not an untouched final benchmark and must never be used as future training data. Regenerate it deterministically with:

```bash
python scripts/generate_benchmark.py \
  --output data/benchmark/imci_v0.jsonl \
  --seed 20240301
```

The historical 14-case `LEGACY_SELECTED_V0_COMPONENT_REGRESSION` slice remains fixed as an archived component regression suite for selected-v0 semantics, information states, acquisition modes, and controlled semantic-to-language conversion. It is not the new product-level holistic golden set and is mechanically ineligible for training, holistic generation, product evaluation, and new teacher selection.

The committed split demonstration proves group-aware leakage controls, but is not the eventual training, validation, or benchmark corpus:

```bash
python scripts/generate_splits.py
```

## Baseline and external-evaluation tooling

The mock runner exercises serialization, prompting, strict scoring, and run-artifact generation without invoking a model:

```bash
python scripts/run_baseline.py \
  --benchmark data/benchmark/imci_v0.jsonl \
  --output experiments/baselines/mock-run/
```

Pinned local MLX Qwen baselines remain useful historical/component evidence. Install the optional model dependencies and run, for example:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[models]"

python scripts/run_model_baseline.py qwen3-0.6b \
  --output experiments/baselines/qwen3-0.6b/internal-v0
```

`configs/external_benchmarks.json` pins two Lundin IMCI benchmark revisions without redistributing them. Lundin is now optional external/generalization evidence and is intentionally off the hackathon critical path. Fetch a pinned revision with:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_external_benchmark.py lundin_current_07c6f0f
```

External results must identify the pinned revision and one of the repository’s separated strict or upstream-compatibility scoring policies. Do not merge Lundin scores with EdgeIMCI product metrics into a single accuracy figure.

- Do not modify the frozen `imci-selected-v0` clinical semantics to make the expanded product model easier to implement.
- Do not treat `UNKNOWN` as negative or manufacture missing observations.
- Do not let language-generation code create or alter clinical truth.
- Do not use the historical 82-case benchmark or archived 14-case selected-v0 slice as training data or as product-level holistic semantics.
- Do not silently convert generic source actions into invented drug names, doses, durations, or regimens.
- Do not call the hackathon review decision set production clinical approval.
- Preserve immutable raw run evidence; derive summaries and cost without overwriting it.
